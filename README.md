 <h2>About Me</h2>  
</div>

<div align="center"><b>Motto: <br/> "A natural problem solver. Driven by the challenge of finding solutions to complex problems"</b></div>  
<br />

10+ years in IT, but I'm not the type to claim I'm some elite hacker manipulating butterflies to redirect cosmic rays onto my hard drive. Just a regular night owl whose brain refuses to shut off.

Weekends? Either somewhere on a trail with my KTM coming home bruised but happy, or grinding and vibing with games until my eyes hurt. Here be my steam account [STEAM](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shir0Yasha07/)  

## 🛠 Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Assembly, Rust, Go, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, R, MATLAB, plus Sundanese, Javanese, Indonesian, and English. Polyglot in both code and conversation. Jack of all trades, master of none, though Rust, Go, and C# are my comfort zone.
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Rocket, Actix, Warp, FastAPI, Next.js, Flutter. Name a framework, I've probably touched it.
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure, Huawei Cloud, DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner, and various local providers (Eranyacloud, BiznetGio, IDCloudhost (warren.io)). If it runs on *nix, I can architect it with HA and automatic failover.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB (yes, even though it's a MySQL fork, they're different enough), MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Elasticsearch. Whatever fits the job. RabbitMQ when I need queues.
- **Infra & DevOps:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Kustomize, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, Git, Linux. Nginx, HAProxy, or Caddy for web servers depending on the mood.
- **Observability:** ELK Stack, Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog APM, Datadog Vector. If something breaks at 3am, I'm the one getting paged, and I'll know exactly where to look.
- **Simulation & Engineering:** EnergyPlus, OpenFOAM, OpenStudio, CODESYS, Mike21, HoneyBee, Grasshopper, COMSOL Multiphysics. Building energy modeling, CFD, PLC programming, oil spill simulations, multiphysics modeling. Yeah, it's a weird combo.
- **Hardware & PCB:** Eagle, Proteus, NI Multisim. Tinkering with circuits when software gets boring.
- **Robotics & Instrumentation:** Intel 8051 (custom build microcontroller), Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Teensy, various sensors and actuators. Engineering Physics background with focus on instrumentation and control. Built a self-balancing Virtual Reality robot, published at 2021 IEEE International Conference on Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, and Communications Technology (IAICT)
- **Other stuff:** A mechanical keyboard with blue switches for that symphony of clickity-clack.

## Current Situation

Open to interesting opportunities, particularly remote roles where the engineering challenges are real and the compensation matches. Hit me up, but expect 1-2 months notice period.
